# githook-json-parser
Automatically validate json files which have pull requests on github (under construction)

### Current State

* Currently this script gets json files from master instead of pull request files.
* Currently accessing patch file directly should use api instead.
* Currently no github account which can automatically respond based on valid or not, need to build this.
